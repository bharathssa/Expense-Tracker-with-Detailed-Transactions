## How It Works

### 1. Participants Input:
- Users enter a comma-separated list of participant names.
- These names are stored and used throughout the expense tracking process.

### 2. Expense Entry:
- Users input expense details, including:
  - Date
  - Category (e.g., "Groceries," "Dining")
  - Total Amount
  - Payer (the person who paid initially)
  - Split Type

### 3. Splitting Logic:
- The application handles different splitting scenarios:
  - **Equally:** Divides the total amount by the number of participants.
  - **Specific Person:** Assigns the expense to a selected group of people.
  - **Shared Purchase:** Allows users to enter individual contributions and calculates who owes or is owed.
  - **Manual Split:** Provides fields for users to define the exact amount each person owes.

### 4. Transaction Calculation:
- The `calculate_transactions` function processes the expense data.
- It generates a list of individual transactions, showing the "From" (debtor), "To" (creditor), and "Amount."

### 5. Output and Display:
- Recorded expenses are displayed with options to edit or delete.
- A table shows all calculated transactions.
- A summary is provided.
- Option to download the transactions as a PDF.
